An unordered list of things currently on my mind:

- [local first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/)
- [SQLite per user](https://turso.tech/blog/give-each-of-your-users-their-own-sqlite-database-b74445f4)
- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) (tmux alternative, written in Rust (btw), with a WASM plugin system)
- [The Update Framework (TUF)](https://theupdateframework.io/)
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/), specifically "features" it makes available for TUI apps to optimize around.
- [Nix](https://nixos.org/) (really [Lix](https://lix.systems/)), specifically how to make it seamless / usable by non Nix "users" for e.g. developer environments.
