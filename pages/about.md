I'm Travis Johnson, a Site Reliability Engineer with a focus on [psychological safety](/pages/philosophy/) and education. I've been in the industry for over a decade, and I've worked in a variety of roles from Linux Systems Administrator, to Head of a 20+ person IT Department.

I'm an armchair programming language design philosopher, and lean pretty hard into a few archtypes. I have long purple hair, I'm autistic (though folks keep telling me "you don't seem autistic"; thanks?), have ADD, and otherwise am pretty well described by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZdxbf0_fPg) (except I'm not _that_ into Rust).

I attend a lot of tech conferences (will probably add a list at some point), work as an Enforcer at PAX[^PAX], and do some crazy things like willingly live ouf my car for months at a time[^car-life] while attending conferences[^cons].

I become known by my co-workers for having a lot of in-depth knowledge about how things work "under the hood", combined with strong opinions of psychological safety and people's workflows. And I never tire of the sound of my own voice.
